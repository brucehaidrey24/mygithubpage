		  <div class="col-md-4">My name is Bruce Haidrey. I am 17 years old and am going to be a senior at El Toro High School. I have 3 siblings and am the youngest out of us 4. Only my sister and I live in this house with my parents and my grandma. My oldest sister stays here whenever she visits. I dont know what the deal is with my brother. One time he says he's staying and the next thing I know he is going back to live in the Santa Monica area. Honestly, I believe he would stay with us as well however there never is much food in this house. We have a pet Gorilla who eats A LOT. He'd be better off living alone and actually having food in the house for a change. That is the reason I am so skinny as well. </div>
		  <div class="col-md-4">I have many interests including basketball, video games, and hanging out with my freinds and family. However, I would have to say my main interest is in men. My brother would always call me "gay" and a "faggot" so I decided to eventually start liking men... well not their whole body just certain body parts. There is this one really hot guy named Professor Geller and everytime he wears a turtle neck in class I just lose focus! Sometimes I would fail my tests so that we could have one on one sessions with no one else around. Call me crazy but I think he's into me as well.</div>
		  <div class="col-md-4">At the start of this summer I first played a lot of basketball. I really don't know why I play since I just hand my teammates water and give them motivational speeches but my brother says every team needs a player like me. And indeed they do :). Once basketball was over I began to have my own mini vacations and would head down to San Diego a few times to hang out with my friends. I also went to Las Vegas a total of two times! Although summer was fun I am ready to join the real world once again and go back to school.</div>
